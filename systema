## 
Power is:
    External:
        physical
    Internal:
        emotional
        spiritual

External & internal

## The external

Tension is the mother of all evil
it prevents you from making a powerful strike

What is tension,
    according to systema

## The stance

Relaxation comes from good
    posture
    structure

Boxing has rules,
    systema does not

Rules create habits
    habit of posture
    of movement

The rules of boxing,
box the fighter into a posture.

You only need to focus on the other fighter
whatever happens around does not matter.

You attack only on the jaw and stomach
so you defend with your shoulders
and you keep yourself small
    these limitations mean that,
    for you to have strength in your strike,
    you need:
        hand speed
        muscle strength

Consider multiple attackers and weapons

*awareness of space*

The boxing posture limits your awareness
to one direction
the one where the one fighter is in

*natural stance*
*openness of posture*

The natural stance is the most open
the one you are aware of the most
and its the one you walk in XD

The power comes from being natural with yourself
from a natural (walking, comftable) posture
    reminds me of stoicism

All joints straight and relaxed

Follow nature
    what's comftable
    what flows easily

If your posture is broken
you put stress on your body
and that creates tension

Does your punch create stress?
    Don't put stress on your body

"There is a moment you are stuck in a position
where you cannot go back easily."
    That is called commitment
And your opponent takes advantage
of your commitment to your posture
while you are vulnerable

*commitment to your posture*
*minimize commitment*?

## the punch

hit with a flat surface of your fist
You can hit with smaller surfaces:
    your nuckles
    arrow heart
but its easier to hurt yourself

Striking is not to damage, or destroy
    its striking is based on healing

*minimize tension*

Relax your shoulder
    minimize tension
    make your arm
    conduit of your energy

tension blocks energy

The metaphor:
    energy flows through your arm
        onto the person
    tension blocks that energy
        like a hose with kinks in it
        that keep water from flowing

Focus on the energy,
    not the fist

There is an abstraction
    not the member
        the fist
    but the flow of energy
    from one body to another

Its the energy that goes 
    into the body
    not the hand XD
    so control the energy
    and the hand is just a conduit

Energy IN
    not THROUGH

You don't treat the human body
    like a board
    or any object
There are lots of things going on in it

## the pushup challenge

kuckle pushups train structure
    the striking structure
Not trying to build big nuckles
    XD
Nor muscles, maybe.
though it IS a benefit

Like muscles is a secondary benefit
to pushups
where the main benefit is the punching structure

The happyness is a side benefit
of the training of virtue

Extend your arms fully
align your hands

Link the breath to the movement

Do a 1 minute pushup!

Try to let go of your tension as you push up slowly

minimize the muscle set 
that you use to make the push up

Look to find only the necessary muscles
Try to find out where you can let go
    Separate sections of your body
    into:
        what you must use
        what you don't need to use

Do ONE pushup a day
    well, 10 seconds down, 10 seconds up
        build up to
        a minute up, a minute down
        see how long you can make your push up!
    constant movement
        no speed up
        no stops
    keep telling yourself to relax

## the internal

emotions elevate in a fight:
    fear
    anger
    frustration

When emotions are high
    you are weakened
Because:
    anger and fear
    create tension
    all over your body

Tension steals power
from what you can deliver
in the punch

And also emotional tension
takes away emotional and intellectal
power.

You are worse at 
remembering the tools you can use
and at using them

So,
    my fear of getting punched
    and my competitiveness against manuel
    gets in the way
    of my power...

Pure intention of a solid strike
    pure from distractions,
    frustrations
    other concerns
    single minded focus
    on self control

Be happy and enjoy the moment
    that relaxes you
your emotions are a tool
to relax yourself

Tension
    anger
    frustration
they stop you.

Happyness and relaxation
    release you
    and give you more power

There is nothing more deadly or more proficient
than a happy fighter
    mike tyson

Find the joy of
    still being alive
    of looking for a solution
and you will be stronger for it

The relaxation lets you 
    accept what's happening
    that prevents you from getting angry
    which creates tension

physical and psychological relaxation

whatever happens is ok
    that way
    you have less tension

The power is already within you
    it a matter of how you let it out
    and tension keeps it locked

Happy Hit!

Make a weekend of it
stay forever
    whatever you like

## observations:

they where down for the pushups
up for the other parts
changing up posture makes clear divisiones
easier to remember the topic
by the posture

# summary

Power is:
    External:
        physical
    Internal:
        emotional
        spiritual

Tension, Stress, Relaxation, Power Release, Follow Nature, Energy, Structure.

Ok, there is energy in your body,
It gets relesed by moving your muscles

Tension is contrary to the flow of energy.
If you are tense, less energy flows from your body
into the object.

Tension is when you activate muscles that are unnecesary.
Tension is when you activate distracting thoughts.
Tension is when you activate disturbing feelings.

That is, anything that goes contrary to the action you are trying
is tension

Stress is another name for tension,
more related to discomfort and hurt.

Relaxation is the opposite of tension?

no, relaxation is how you manage tension.
You relax the muscles you don't need to use, 
and that reduces tension

The fine control between tension and relaxation
gives the most efficient flow of power

Follow nature.
Like in stoicism, unnatural things feel tense, and natural things feel relaxed.
unnatural feels uncomftable, and natural feels comftable.
Natural is also the ideal management of tension and relaxation.
if it feels comftable and easy and natural, it is the right balance
of tension and relaxation.

Energy = Power.

One of the ways to minimize tension is by controlling your posture.
The wrong posture requires a lot of tension to maintain.
The right posture can be kept while being very relaxed.

The search for the right structure (posture)
comes from exploring all the positions you can put your body in,
and choosing the one with least tension.

But there is a way to systematically find those least-tense structures:
    long pushups.

In a 1 minute pushup, you have to focus on your entire body,
and find what muscles you can activate or deactivate.
You are mindful (XD) of tension, and take the time to turn it off
where its not needed.

        
        Tension
Power   ->              Object
        Relaxation

You explore the structure-space, search for the one with minimal tension use.

What's best feels easy and natural.

One minute pushup
    to explore structure

Use the least amount of muscles
tense the least amount of muscles
and cartilages

Commitment:
    when you do a kick, you have to give some time to it.
    You also need to give a little of your balance.
    and some energy is lost to moving the foot.
All the things you give up to do the kick
is your commitment to it.
Explore what you can do with your body,
so you minimize the commitment you do
to each kick

Space awareness:
    fight aware of the entire space around you.
    the positions of the other enemies.
    the size of the ring.
maybe even the position in the tournament,
your position in the tiredness scale,
your opponent's position on it.
Mostly context aware, for all the contexts.

Pure intention:
    when all actuators align.
    When you focus on only one goal
        , and all distractions are out of mind
    Purity of directionality.
    there is only your goal in your mind

# myself

you have actuators, and you activate them to do stuff.
You activate your muscles to move,
but if you activate muscles that you don't need to move,
then they are going in the direction opposite of yours

There is your arm (a structure) with muscles (actuators).
To move your arm, like, to reach a pen, 
    you tense some muscles, and relax others.
The muscles that tense together for the same goal
    with the minimal pressure,
    are aligned.
Any muscle you tense that increases pressure
    without adding to the goal
    are misaligned

Pressure:
    when two muscles tense together, but the arm does not move.
    The the tension from the muscles does not go from the arm to the goal.
    it stays in the arm, as pressure

Your arm is just an example.
Every system has a structure and actuators.
and those actuators can be aligned or misaligned.
If your emotions put pressure on you without contributing to your goal
    like getting the homework done.
Then the actuators of your psyche are misaligned
    and you have only pressure over you
    without movement
