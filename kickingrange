kicking:

Ranges
    of different parts of the body
    from closest to farthest:
        clinch
        elbow
            elbow range
        knees
        punching
            push out of frame range
                stiff jab range
                    jab range
        kicking range
                    close kicking range
                        side kick out of frame range
                            side kick to the chest range

"they are not just brocks at the end of our legs
that we throw and cause pain with"

Uses of kicks and movements:
    push
    direct
        steering the opponent
    jab
        frontal attack
    thrust kick
        closer

The fighiting range is what's important
    the rest of the ranges are the tools

What are you gonna do 
    once you are inside that range

Ranges determine what you can do
    by limiting what part of your body you can use
but the ranges of 
    different parts of your body
    overlap
so within a single distance
    there are several members
    you can use

How to make this concept work for you

hoop and leg extension.

Put a hand ahead of you.
Raise your leg so the knee is below that hand
    you can only hinge
    on your knee
    to make damage
BUT,
if you raise your knee before and a little above that hand
    you can extend your hole leg straight
    and do more force
SO,
    bring in your knee tight

Chanbering kicks
    outside
    inside

The hand defines your chamber
    chamber outside
        under or ahead of the hand
    chamber inside
        before and above the kicking target

Hoop:
    an imaginary cylinder
    around your body
What is it useful for?

"Don't sacrifice your:
    posture
    breathing
    balance
just hang in there"

chambering inside the hoop
gives you a shorter range with
your kicks
    and more options for kicking

# summary

Ranges
    of different parts of the body
    from closest to farthest:
        clinch
        elbow
            elbow range
        knees
        punching
            push out of frame range
                stiff jab range
                    jab range
        kicking range
                    close kicking range
                        side kick out of frame range
                            side kick to the chest range

Uses of kicks and movements:
    push
    direct
        steering the opponent
    jab
        frontal attack
    thrust kick
        push out of frame
        closer

Hoop:
    an imaginary circle around your body
    like a hoola hoop
    that marks the difference between
        one articulation part
        two articulation parts
    so that you can
        push
        and not just kick

Chambering
    the place 
        (relative to the hoop)
    where you put your articulation.

Chambering out
    means the articulation is outside the hoop
    and you have less of a choice to kick or push

chambering in
    means the articulation is before the hoop
    and you can choose between kick and push
